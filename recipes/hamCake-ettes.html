    <p> 
    Easter ham turns into a perfect combo of pancakes and croquettes for a nice way to use up some of the leftovers. Serve
    with a honey mustard sauce or any variety of chutneys. Applesauce is also a nice accompaniment.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>3 green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix ham, mashed potatoes, green onions, egg, Dijon mustard, dill weed, salt, black pepper, and 1/4 cup panko bread
            crumbs together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. If mixture is too moist to hold together, mix in an additional 1/4
            cup of crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place remaining panko crumbs into a shallow bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoop about 1/3 cup of the mixture and form into a ball; slightly flatten into a patty. Press both sides of patty into
            the panko crumbs; tap off any loose crumbs. Repeat with remaining mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until very hot; pan-fry 2 or 3 patties at a time in the hot oil until
            golden brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>
